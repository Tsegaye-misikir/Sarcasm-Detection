# Sarcasm-Detection

A university Lab project. 

  Sarcasm is a form of verbal irony that is intended to express contempt or ridicule. Relying on the shared knowledge between the speaker and his audience, sarcasm requires wit to understand and wit to produce. In our daily interactions, we use gestures and mimics, intonation and prosody to hint the sarcastic intent. Since we do not have access to such paralinguistic cues, detecting sarcasm in written text is a much harder task.

Here is one of the definitions of sarcasm to better understand it: "Use of words that mean the opposite of what you really want to say, especially in order to show irritation or just to be funny". 

In this project I am going to investigate this sarcastic dataset https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/qpkodtmj5a6p4z3/sarcasm.zip?dl=0  .
